# Advent of Code 2022

This is my set of solutions for the Advent of Code 2022 challenge, written in
Go!

You can run them yourself, you'll just need to set the environment variable
`SESSION_COOKIE={{cookie}}`, which can be retrieved from your browser after
logging in to AoC.

I'll be uploading these _when I finish them_ so this repo may contain spoilers
for challenges you have not yet completed.
