# Advent of Code 2022

This is my set of solutions for the Advent of Code 2022 challenge, written in
Go!

You can run them yourself, you'll just need to set the environment variable
`SESSION_COOKIE={{cookie}}`, which can be retrieved from your browser after
logging in to AoC.

You can also change where the inputs are saved to with the
`LOCAL_FOLDER={{dir}}` environment variable - it defaults to `inputs`.

Finally, the environment variable `TRACE={{bool}}` will enable debug logging -
this is mostly for my use but if you want verbose logs then this is the place to
look.
